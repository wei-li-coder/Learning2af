Folder 'preprocess_data' contains codes for preprocessing the public dataset and making my own dataset for train.

Folder 'train' contains codes for training with MobileNet_V2 in this dataset.

progress.csv contains the whole training progress. __Update in 08.13__ Now it seems the model fails to learn well. It had a poor performance on both the training set and the testing set.
